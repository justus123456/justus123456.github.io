                <h1>Quality Coffee Sourcing & Roasting</h1>
            <p>
                Through trusted relationships with growers and importers, we are able to source some of the most exceptional coffees in the world, always in pursuit of seasonal selections that meet or exceed our quality standards. <br><br>
                We roast our coffee to order in small batches out of our roastery in Long Island City, NY. Our roasting team maintains a rigorous and ongoing quality control program, sampling every batch that we roast, with the needs and expectations of our customers first in mind.  <br> <br>
                Joe offers delivery for our New York-based customers and low delivery minimums to make the ordering experience stress-free. Not in New York? We are happy to ship anywhere in the U.S. and will accommodate international shipping on a case-by-case basis. Please get in touch to learn more!
